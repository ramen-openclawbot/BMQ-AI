-- Backlog ranking must not depend on Giai đoạn 3 routing having run.
-- Before 2026-10-17 every confirmed receipt had receiving_location null, so
-- get_material_alias_backlog('q7') returned nothing and the scan did no work.
-- Ranking is read-only (it only fills material_alias_jev_cache), so a receipt
-- without a warehouse is ranked under the supplier default, falling back to q7.
-- Exempt suppliers and lines already marked non_stock are skipped.
